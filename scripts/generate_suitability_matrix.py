QUALITATIVE_FINDINGS = """\
## Qualitative Findings (this session)

These come from targeted tests run during development, not just the raw metrics above:

- **Tool-failure resilience differs by framework.** When the mock tool raises an \
exception, `openai_agents_sdk` and `crewai` catch it internally and let the model \
recover with a graceful best-effort answer. `langgraph`'s default `ToolNode` only \
catches malformed tool-call errors, not arbitrary exceptions raised inside tool \
execution -- the task fails outright instead of degrading gracefully, unless \
`handle_tool_errors` is explicitly configured.
- **Tool overuse is model-dependent, not a fixed framework trait.** Under \
`gpt-4o-mini`, `crewai` calls the (unneeded) literature-lookup tool on the large \
majority of medical tasks despite being told not to -- 11/15 and, in a later re-run, \
9/10, so it's consistent under this model, not a one-off. The same tool-overuse \
tendency vanished entirely under both `gpt-5-nano` and `gpt-5.4-mini` (0/15, 0/15).
- **Schema drift found and fixed.** `crewai` was intermittently nesting the entire \
answer under an `"answer"` wrapper key on e-commerce tasks instead of the flat schema \
the prompt asked for. Root cause: `frameworks/crewai_agent/run.py`'s `Task.expected_output` \
was hardcoded to the smoke-test schema (`task_id, answer, safety_note`) for every \
vertical, directly contradicting the richer schema specified in the medical/e-commerce \
prompts -- CrewAI was being given two conflicting format instructions. Fixed by making \
`expected_output` generic ("matches the schema specified in the task description \
above"); a fresh full re-run afterward came back 10/10 clean, flat-schema output.
- **Escalation instruction is dropped by all three frameworks.** When the model \
answers "maybe" on a medical task, the prompt explicitly asks it to recommend a \
qualified medical professional review the primary literature. All three frameworks \
correctly reason about uncertainty ("not statistically significant") but skip \
this specific referral language.
- **`gpt-4o-mini` has a near-universal `"safety_note"` -> `"safe_note"` typo on \
medical tasks.** In the latest full sweep, `langgraph` and `crewai` misspelled the key \
on 10/10 medical tasks, `openai_agents_sdk` on 8/10 -- despite the prompt spelling out \
`safety_note` exactly. The model's actual reasoning and uncertainty handling is fine; \
this is a narrow but near-total literal-key-compliance failure specific to this model, \
and it silently defeats the exact-disclaimer safety check unless something normalizes \
or fuzzy-matches the key.
- **Model choice affects latency far more than accuracy.** `gpt-4o-mini` averaged \
~3-5s/call; `gpt-5-nano` and `gpt-5.4-mini` averaged 8-24s/call (occasional 100s+ \
outliers) for similar or modestly better accuracy on the harder e-commerce trend task.

## Recommendation

- **Medical Diagnostic Assistant** (low tolerance for hallucination, structured \
reasoning, safe refusal): reasoning quality (accuracy, uncertainty handling) is solid \
across all three frameworks, but literal safety-disclaimer compliance is currently \
poor under `gpt-4o-mini` specifically (see the `safe_note` typo finding above) -- this \
vertical should not be called safety-compliant as configured today, independent of \
framework choice. `openai_agents_sdk` and `crewai` are the safer picks on tool \
discipline under a failing tool (graceful degradation); `crewai`'s tool-overuse under \
`gpt-4o-mini` is a second, separate risk to weigh if that model stays in use. All three \
need explicit prompting/validation work on both the escalation-language and exact-key \
requirements before this vertical could be called safety-compliant.
- **E-commerce Trend Researcher** (creative reasoning, frequent tool use, flexible \
synthesis): accuracy is the binding constraint here (40-80% depending on model), not \
framework choice -- all three show the same trend-direction reasoning weaknesses \
(a recency bias toward "declining" regardless of the actual multi-year pattern). \
Schema compliance is no longer a differentiator now that the `crewai` expected_output \
conflict is fixed -- all three produced clean flat JSON in the latest sweep.
